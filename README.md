# AllStar
_______________________________________________________________________________________________

Patches and files to compile AllStar Asterisk on Debian i386 Platforms.

This is a work in progress that has been forked from N4IRS. The plan is to modify the scripting
to make the installer run under a installation environment that is currently in production and 
not destroy the current system. 

If you are installing from a newly initialized drive you will be required to do a base install 
of debian then run the asterisk installation script here. 

This modified script is geared towards x86 platforms only, Thin Clients are cheaper and 
more powerful than SBCs I see no need for SBCs as controllers. If your looking for SBC 
installations you should use the original scripting and or images from N4IRS.

I started the mods to N4IRS scripting to make custom install files for our link system.
I do not plan on supporting this out side of the Louisiana Link System but if you have a use
for what is posted by all means use it.

Please remember I am not a script writer by trade, I am more of a script cut and paster! 
I am only modifing what N4IRS has already made to more suit my needs, Please pass all the
glory to him!
